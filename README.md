Cover My Crutches
=================
I recently tore up my knee and had surgery. Being a bored hacker laid up in bed I decided to learn [Meteor](http://meteor.com) and build a simple site where companies and startups can pay to have their sticker on one of crutches.

Visit [Cover My Crutches](http://www.covermycrutches.com) to donate and send a sticker.
